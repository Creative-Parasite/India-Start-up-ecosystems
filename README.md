# üó∫Ô∏è India-Start-up-ecosystems
We embark on a journey of discovery as we leverage our data analysis expertise in a team of six to uncover the untapped potential within the Indian start-up ecosystem.

## Scope of work 
The sustainability of every business is dependent on a country's ecosystem in terms of productivity and ability to develop niches like startups and opportunities that increase the economic levels. For this particular project, our aim is to venture into india as a startup company,assess how feasible the business will be and mitigate all risk factors that may arise while venturing into India's startup industries. For the survival of the business, the project will be evaluating the following: 
- Conducting a thorough exploration of datasets, dissecting funding patterns, sectoral nuances, and geographical hotspots in the Indian startup landscape
- Analyze funding received by startups in india from 2018 to 2021

## üíπ Structure of analysis 
The project data will be extracted on external sources showcasing different startups in various industries with the level of funding they have received and its impact of performance on India's ecosystem. The analysis will be delving down into four major ecosystem sectors which include Funds, Investors, Industry and Geographical location each answering a set of business questions that will drive our hypothesis into making a decision in investing in India.  
#### Hypothesis 
**Null hypothesis** 
The funds have zero impact to the ecosystem sectors in India.
**Alternative hypothesis** 
The funds have a huge impact to the ecosystem sectors in India.

Further, we will be assessing the following:
- Data cleaning
