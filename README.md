        ```
        python -m venv env
        ```

  - **Activate the virtual environment:**
    ```
        env/Scripts/activate
    ```

- **Data cleaning** 
- **Hypothesis testing** 
- **Business analysis**

## Usage
-To run the project do paste the clone to your VS CODE

- Use functions in the `notebook`
  
  **example:**
  
  def concat_dataframes(data1,data2, data3, data4):
    result = pd.concat([df1, df2, df3,df4], axis=0)
    return result
  
## üîÑ Optimization 
-- Refactor this function with your dataset index for optimal performance of the function.

-**Run the function once:**

def swap_row_cells(df, row_index, col1_index, col2_index):

    """
    Swaps the values in the given columns and row of a data array.
    Parameters:
    df (list): A 2D list representing the data array.
    row_index (int): The index of the first column.
    col1_index (int): The index of the second column.
    col2_index (int): The index of the row where the values are swapped.
    Returns:
    list: The modified data array with swapped values.
    """
    
    df.loc[row_index, [col1_index,col2_index]] = df.loc[row_index,[col2_index,col1_index]].values
    return df
